# Ocelot Media Manager v0.2c

Ocelot is an audio player and library organizer, built with Qt and TagLib.
It's aim is to create a player light on resources by utilizing near-stock Qt Widgets, while also retaining some of the native look-and-feel of each platform.

_This project is currently in an early stage of development! As such, many planned features are still not present._
