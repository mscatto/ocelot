## Ocelot Media Manager v0.3a
Ocelot is an audio player and (hopefully soon) a library manager.

It is built using Qt Widgets, with some key features made possible by TagLib, KFileMetadata and ProjectM projects.

>Ocelot is released under the MIT license, you can read more about it  in the supplied LICENSE file.

* _This project is currently in an early stage of development! As such, many planned features are still not present._
* TagLib is being phased out in favor of KFileMetadata. It is expected to be dropped somewhere in the future.

#

>### <b>BINARY</b>
A precompiled binary from v0.3a is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscatto/ocelot/master/ocelot-bin).
>### <b>BUILDING</b>
Ocelot requires Qt Frameworks version 5.10 or above, QtMultimedia, KFileMetadata and TagLib development files.
* QtMultimedia makes use of GStreamer for audio playback on unix-like platforms, so you need to install it and the required plugins for your media formats. Most likely you want the _good_, _bad_ and _base_ packages.

On Arch, you'll need the following packages:
`qt5-multimedia qt5-base taglib make gcc kfilemetadata`

You can build and run with:
`qmake . && make && ./ocelot`

>### <b>PLANNED</b>

* Milkdrop visualization support
* Mass tagger and batch renamer
* Batch transcode
* Custom album import
* Colored UI

>### <b>WHAT WORKS</b>

* Basic library management
* Music playback
* Playlist manager and export
* Layout editor

>### <b>QUESTIONS</b>
><b>Why?</b><br>I simply don't want to give up on what I had with Foobar2k, but sadly it's Windows-only. I'm also not very fond of the WINE experience, so I'm trying the recreate what I liked about it.</br></br>
><b>When will [...]?</b></br>
When it's doneâ„¢</br></br>
><b>Can I submit a patch?</b></br>Contributions are certainly welcome, but the codebase needs some cleanup and there's no documentation yet. If this does not drive you away, then sure!
